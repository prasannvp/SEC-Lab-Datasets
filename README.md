- For **Experiment 2**: Use this data to calculate descriptive statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation) for Per Capita GDDP across Karnataka districts.
- For **Experiment 3**: Use the inflation rate data to create time series charts, add trendlines, and forecast future values.
- For **Experiment 4**: Use this data for creating scatter plots (Education vs Income), histograms (Income distribution), and box plots (Income by Sector).
